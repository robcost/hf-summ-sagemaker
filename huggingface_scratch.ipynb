    "patent = '''summarize: To minimize the limitations found in the prior art, and to minimize other limitations that will be apparent upon the reading of the specifications, the present invention provides an electric car having a vertical row of seat for accommodating at least one passenger. The electric car comprises a center console placed at an interior forepart of the electric car. A steering is attached to the center console. A rectangular seat is mounted on a rectangular box, the rectangular box being longitudinally placed at a center part of the electric car. A storage area is enclosed within the rectangular box, the storage area includes a personal storage and a battery storage. The battery storage includes a battery pack having a set of rechargeable batteries. The battery pack is used to power the electric car. A plug point is located at a rear end of the electric car for charging the battery pack. A pair of rotatable front wheels and a pair of rotatable back wheels are provided for ensuring smooth movement of the electric car. Both the center console and the steering of the electric car are aligned with the rectangular seat. The rectangular seat is mounted on the rectangular box having the storage area in order to save space. The electric car is configured to have a compact seating arrangement. A back support may be provided for a driver's rectangular seat. The electric car is specially designed to achieve better performance by increasing the energy efficiency and reducing the power consumption. The at least one passenger can be seated facing front direction with one leg on each side of the rectangular seat. The electric car is capable of accommodating more passengers with relatively small size and with minimum power consumption during transportation.\n",
    "      In alternate embodiment of the present invention at least one step and ladder seat is positioned at the center part of the electric car. The electric car comprises a car body having a front end, a rear end, a top portion and a bottom portion. A center console placed at an interior forepart of the electric car. A steering is attached to the center console. At least one step and ladder seat is positioned at the center part of the electric car for accommodating at least one passenger. In addition to the at least one step and ladder seat, a horizontal row of seats for accommodating a pair of passengers is located at the rear end of the vehicle. A battery storage having a battery pack is positioned at the bottom portion of step and ladder seat for powering the electric car. A plug point is located at a rear end of the electric car for charging the battery pack. A personal storage is placed at the rear end of horizontal row of seat.\n",
    "      One objective of the invention is to provide an electric car capable of accommodating four or more passengers with relatively smaller vehicle size.\n",
    "      Another objective of the invention is to provide an electric car with compact seating arrangement.\n",
    "      A third objective of the invention is to provide an electric car with better performance by increasing the energy efficiency and reducing the power consumption.\n",
    "      These and other advantages and features of the present invention are described with specificity so as to make the present invention understandable to one of ordinary skill in the art.'''"
