    "patent = '''BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE\n",
    "\n",
    "      1. Technical Field of the Disclosure\n",
    "      This embodiment relates in general to electric cars. More specifically, the preferred embodiment relates to an electric car having a vertical row of seats.\n",
    "      2. Description of the Related Art\n",
    "      An electric car is powered by an electric motor using electrical energy stored in batteries or other charged devices. Electric cars are environment friendly as it do not produce any harmful gases such as carbon monoxide, organic compounds, hydro carbons etc. Electric cars are economical because of very low maintenance and operating costs.\n",
    "      Conventional electric cars have considerable drawbacks. For example, an existing electric car includes an electric drive and at least one connected electrical energy storage module. A guide extends longitudinally along the motor vehicle, and supports the storage module in a manner relative to the motor vehicle. Conventional electric cars employ horizontal rows of seats consuming excess space.\n",
    "      Another existing electric vehicle is capable of carrying at least two passengers and has at least three wheels. Passengers sit in tandem and most of the batteries or fuel cell systems are located to the sides of the passengers. This vehicle has an aerodynamically shaped body with substantially reduced frontal area and drag. The body is lightweight, made from shock absorbing materials and structures, and has pressure-airless tires, which enhances the safety of the passengers. The vehicle also includes an advanced hydrogen-electric hybrid propulsion system with quick refueling from existing infrastructure and various additional optional features and systems. However the batteries or fuel cell systems are placed to the sides of the passengers which increases the overall the dimension and weight of the vehicle.\n",
    "      Yet another existing electrical car embodiment is comprised of bodywork with ground-engaging wheels for vehicle motion over the ground, the bodywork contains an electric motor to drive the vehicle via the wheels and batteries to power the electric motor.\n",
    "      This embodiment provides an additional energy generation means comprised of a tunnel extending through the bodywork. It includes a turbine fan/alternator set located in the tunnel at the rear of the vehicle where electrical energy is generated during vehicle motion to charge the batteries. This results in improved performance of the vehicle, especially with regard to its range. The inlet to the tunnel at the vehicle front constitutes the major portion of the vehicles frontal area. A special alternator is provided, and the vehicle can also include a solar cell means for battery charging. However, the seats are placed far apart which consumes a lot of space.\n",
    "      Hence, it can be seen, that there is a need for an electric car that contains a vertical rows of seats. This needed electric car would save more space than existing models to form a vehicle of smaller size with more passengers. Moreover, this needed electric car would consume less power and use a less bulky charging means during transportation. The present embodiment accomplishes these objectives.\n",
    "SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE\n",
    "\n",
    "      To minimize the limitations found in the prior art, and to minimize other limitations that will be apparent upon the reading of the specifications, the present invention provides an electric car having a vertical row of seat for accommodating at least one passenger. The electric car comprises a center console placed at an interior forepart of the electric car. A steering is attached to the center console. A rectangular seat is mounted on a rectangular box, the rectangular box being longitudinally placed at a center part of the electric car. A storage area is enclosed within the rectangular box, the storage area includes a personal storage and a battery storage. The battery storage includes a battery pack having a set of rechargeable batteries. The battery pack is used to power the electric car. A plug point is located at a rear end of the electric car for charging the battery pack. A pair of rotatable front wheels and a pair of rotatable back wheels are provided for ensuring smooth movement of the electric car. Both the center console and the steering of the electric car are aligned with the rectangular seat. The rectangular seat is mounted on the rectangular box having the storage area in order to save space. The electric car is configured to have a compact seating arrangement. A back support may be provided for a driver's rectangular seat. The electric car is specially designed to achieve better performance by increasing the energy efficiency and reducing the power consumption. The at least one passenger can be seated facing front direction with one leg on each side of the rectangular seat. The electric car is capable of accommodating more passengers with relatively small size and with minimum power consumption during transportation.\n",
    "      In alternate embodiment of the present invention at least one step and ladder seat is positioned at the center part of the electric car. The electric car comprises a car body having a front end, a rear end, a top portion and a bottom portion. A center console placed at an interior forepart of the electric car. A steering is attached to the center console. At least one step and ladder seat is positioned at the center part of the electric car for accommodating at least one passenger. In addition to the at least one step and ladder seat, a horizontal row of seats for accommodating a pair of passengers is located at the rear end of the vehicle. A battery storage having a battery pack is positioned at the bottom portion of step and ladder seat for powering the electric car. A plug point is located at a rear end of the electric car for charging the battery pack. A personal storage is placed at the rear end of horizontal row of seat.\n",
    "      One objective of the invention is to provide an electric car capable of accommodating four or more passengers with relatively smaller vehicle size.\n",
    "      Another objective of the invention is to provide an electric car with compact seating arrangement.\n",
    "      A third objective of the invention is to provide an electric car with better performance by increasing the energy efficiency and reducing the power consumption.\n",
    "      These and other advantages and features of the present invention are described with specificity so as to make the present invention understandable to one of ordinary skill in the art.'''\n",
